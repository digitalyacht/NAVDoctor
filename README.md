The NAVDoctor wireless NMEA2000 Diagnostic Tool is designed to allow a marine installation engineer to test and diagnose NMEA 2000 networks.

NAVDoctor shares the same form factor and enclosure as our NavLink2 wireless NMEA 2000 gateway and takes its power from the NMEA 2000 network via its integral NMEA 2000 drop cable, which is terminated in the standard M12 male NMEA 2000 connector.
