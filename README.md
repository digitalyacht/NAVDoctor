The NAVDoctor wireless NMEA2000 Diagnostic Tool is designed to allow a marine installation engineer to test and diagnose NMEA 2000 networks.

NAVDoctor shares the same form factor and enclosure as our NavLink2 wireless NMEA 2000 gateway and takes its power from the NMEA 2000 network via its integral NMEA 2000 drop cable, which is terminated in the standard M12 male NMEA 2000 connector.

Once plugged in to a spare "T-Piece" on the NMEA 2000 network, NAVDoctor will create its own wireless network with an SSID (wireless network name) of **NavDoctor-xxxx** where xxxx is the last four digits of its MAC address. The wireless password is **PASS-xxxx** where xxxx is the same four digits as the SSID.

Once wirelessly connected, open a browser on your mobile device and you should be able to access the NAVDoctor's web interface at...

http://192.168.1.1   or   http://navdoctor.local 

...which will display the home page as shown below.
